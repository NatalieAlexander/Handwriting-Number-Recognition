# 1. Abstract
In this assignment, neural net and support vector machine models were built to classify handwritten images
as even or odd numbers. Parameter tuning was performed to obtain the optimal model. Finally, the best
model (a neural net model with test accuracy = 0.950), was used to classify an unseen, unlabeled data set.

# 2. Introduction
Support vector machines (SVMs) and neural networks (NNs) are used for classification of categorical- and
regression of numeric-dependent variables. The SVM algorithm works by generating a decision boundary
or hyperplane that separates the dependent variable into distinct binary classes. A kernel function is used
to transform the data into a high-dimensional feature space. As a result, the non-linear boundary of the
untransformed feature space becomes a linear boundary in the transformed feature space. The Gaussian
kernel function, which is implemented in this assignment, is used when there is no prior knowledge about the
data [1]. On the other hand, neural networks are powerful and versatile when it comes to learning complex
relationships and patterns in high-dimensional data. Neural networks
